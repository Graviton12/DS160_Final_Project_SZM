Lung cancer is a type of cancer that begins in the lungs and spreads to other organs of the body. It is the second most common form of cancer worldwide with at least 2.2 million cases reported per year. Thus, it is crucial to identify factors that can possibly predict the likelihood of developing lung cancer. This exploratory data analysis will look into the possible predictors of lung cancer given various factors and symptoms collected from patients. Additionally, we will analyze what factors and symptoms are most likely associated with lung cancer in hopes of identifying whether a patient has a higher or lower likelihood of developing lung cancer.
